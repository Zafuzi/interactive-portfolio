	<section>
		<p>Hey there, I'm Zach, a full stack developer with over 5 years of experience. I specialize in interface development for web and mobile with a focus on simplicity and long-term support.</p>
		<p>I am currently brewing awesome potions as a Software Alchemist at <a href="https://wow.boomlearning.com" target="_blank">Boom Learning</a>.
			Before that I studied the ancient tomes at <a href="https://sleepless.com" target="_blank">Sleepless Inc.</a> and learned the spells <b>vim</b> and <b>grep</b>.
		</p>
		<p>I even play around with making <a href="https://zafuzi.itch.io/" target="_blank">video games</a>. Even if they aren't very good, it's the fun I have along the way that is the real treasure.</p>
